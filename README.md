# krita_helper

Just a small script to draw more efficiently in krita.

## Installation

I'm lazy so just open it with tools > script > scripter and import the file, then run.

## usage

This is a small script that create two actions :

* Take a lineart and prepare coloring by adding layers and groups for proper organisation :

    container
    |
    |------- lineart
    |         |
    |         |------- [your selected layers]
    |
    |------- colors
             |
             |-------- base (add color here)

* Take a layer, split the alpha and organize everything  to easily add shaders, textures, ... to your drawing. 

    container
    |
    |------- mask
    |
    |------- base color

By using thoses two scripts together, you can achieve faster complexe drawing with a lot of detail and still keep organized workspace !
